        all by yourself in the middle of the mountains but yet in 5 to 10 minutes eating at a great restaurant
        or local eatery. Very well taken care of and a perfect place to recharge yourself.`

        amazing and so private! We saw some deer had a fire and listened to all the sounds of nature. Coffee on the
        upstairs deck. So relaxing We cannnot wait to come back!`

        expectations! We were lucky enough to get a last minute reservation that did not disappoint! Great place for
        a family get away to disconnect from the city for a while. If this is available you book!`

        It is quiet and secluded without being remote. It is just as clean as the pics and has everything you need for a getaway.
        That being said if you have a four wheel drive vehicle, bring it. :) they will let you borrow the work truck if you do not.
        We are definitely going to go back again.`

        and the house has everything you need to be comfortable. We loved star gazing from the deck, truly unbeatable views, and loved all
        the wildlife that came to visit. Lovely, peaceful place.`

        review: `This place is special. It offers seclusion (while still being just a few minutes from town) and total tranquility. If you enjoy
        nature and quiet, this is the place for you. We enjoyed the hike around the fire tower. The inside is lovely and modern, but has the rustic
        charm of wood all around. Just beautiful. And, if we forgot to bring something, they probably already had it. If they don't, there's plenty
        of stores within a 10 minute drive. I would highly recommend this place.`
